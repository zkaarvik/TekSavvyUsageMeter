TekSavvyUsageMeter
==================

Very simple chrome extension to view your current usage for the month. Will display the amount of usage that counts towards your monthly limit (peak download only). 

You will need your API key, which can be found on the tekSavvy website. 

Currently in a working but unfinished state. I would like to refine the UI as well as add some additional features, like a usage graph.
